Eddit a  SSH device

    esdm -e mydevice

    Enter the new username (leave empty to keep existing): new user name
    Enter the new password (leave empty to keep existing): new password

How it works

esdm uses a JSON file to store the SSH devices. The file is located in the home directory of the user who runs the tool. The file is named ~/.SDM/ssh_devices.json.

The JSON file is a dictionary where the keys are the device names and the values are the device information. The device information includes the IP address, username, and password.

When the user runs the esdm tool, it first checks if the JSON file exists. If it does not exist, the tool creates a new empty file.

The tool then parses the command-line arguments. If the user specifies the -r option, the tool connects to the remote device. To do this, the tool uses the device information from the JSON file.

If the user specifies the -a option, the tool adds a new SSH device to the JSON file. The tool prompts the user for the device name, IP address, username, and password.

If the user specifies the -l option, the tool lists all of the saved SSH devices.

If the user specifies the -d option, the tool deletes a saved SSH device from the JSON file.
